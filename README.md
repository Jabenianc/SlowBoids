# Boids
A repository for my first C++ project, boids.
- Made with C++ and SDL2. Sounds and music are royalty free,
  obstacle and boid sprites are made by me.
- A decent computer should be able to run 2500 boids (mine can only do 1500 at good fps)
- Requires SDL2, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, and tbb
  (for parallel processing)
